"""Cognito Admin API calls used to mint session tokens for a user whose identity we've
already verified ourselves (via Sign in with Apple, see app/auth/apple.py).

Why this dance instead of Cognito's built-in federated-IdP support: federating Apple
directly in the Cognito User Pool routes auth through Cognito's Hosted UI (a browser
redirect), which doesn't fit a native iOS Sign in with Apple flow well and requires
Apple Developer + Cognito Console setup (Services ID, private key, Hosted UI domain)
that isn't in place yet. Instead, we treat Cognito purely as the token issuer:
  1. Verify Apple's token ourselves (app/auth/apple.py).
  2. Ensure a matching Cognito user exists (AdminCreateUser, first sign-in only).
  3. Reset that user's password to a fresh random value and immediately use it to log
     in (AdminSetUserPassword + AdminInitiateAuth). The password itself is never seen
     by the user or stored anywhere — it exists only to satisfy Cognito's requirement
     that ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH have *some* credential to check.

This requires the User Pool App Client to have ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH and
ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH enabled, and be a *public* client (no client secret) — the app
client should not have a secret, since it's called from this backend on behalf of a
mobile app, and a secret provides no real protection for a backend whose credentials
would themselves need securing the same way. If the App Client does have a secret,
SECRET_HASH would need to be added to every call below.

IAM: the backend's execution role needs cognito-idp:AdminCreateUser,
cognito-idp:AdminSetUserPassword, cognito-idp:AdminInitiateAuth,
cognito-idp:InitiateAuth, and cognito-idp:GlobalSignOut on this User Pool's ARN. The
latter two back refresh_tokens()/global_sign_out(), which use the public (non-admin)
API operations — they're authorized primarily by the token being presented rather than
by caller identity, but boto3 still signs every call with the instance's IAM
credentials, so the role needs these actions allowed too.
