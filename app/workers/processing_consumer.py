"""Long-polls the processing SQS queue and classifies/extracts info from uploaded
documents.

The queue is fed by the documents bucket itself: Terraform wires an
`s3:ObjectCreated:*` notification to it (Arya-Infra modules/storage), so a message
arrives the moment a file lands in S3. The API has no permission to send to this
queue and doesn't need one - uploads are the trigger.

That timing suits the two kinds of document differently:

  PDFs are processed straight away. Their tables are read from the file's own
  geometry (pdf_table_extractor), which needs nothing from the client.

  Photos have no geometry, only the OCR text the client submits afterwards via
  POST /documents/{id}/text - which may not have arrived when the S3 event does.
  Those messages are left undeleted so SQS redelivers them after the visibility
  timeout, by which point the text is usually there. After maxReceiveCount they
  move to the `-dlq` queue, which is where a photo whose text never came ends up.

Runs as a standalone supervisord program on the same EB SingleInstance environment as
the API, not inside the FastAPI event loop.
